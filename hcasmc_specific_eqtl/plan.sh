#### hcasmc specific eqtl on full sample 
# for each eqtl gene pair, determine whether its m-value s >=0.9 in HCASMC and < 0.9 in all other tissues
# output these eqtl gene pair 
# plot these eqtl gene pair 


#### hcasmc specific eqtl on subsampled tissue: 
# run metasoft on subsampled tissues
# repeat steps in full sample analysis 


# 1. form metasoft input 
# 2. while waiting, write scripts to find hcasmc specific eqtl on full sample 
# 2.5 make manhattan plot
# 3. run metasoft
# 4. find hcasmc specific eqtl on subsampled tissues.
