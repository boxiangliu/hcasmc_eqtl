Goal

#### hcasmc specific eqtl on full sample 
for each eqtl gene pair, determine whether its m-value s >=0.9 in HCASMC and < 0.9 in all other tissues
output these eqtl gene pair 
plot these eqtl gene pair 


#### hcasmc specific eqtl on subsampled tissue: 
# run metasoft on subsampled tissues
# repeat steps in full sample analysis 


#### tissue specific eqtls:
