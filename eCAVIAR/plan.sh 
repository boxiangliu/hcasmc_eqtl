# parse the SNP id column in eQTL file
# split eqtl files by chromosomes
# for each chromosome: 
# 	select eGenes

#### why does some eCAVIAR input fail? 
# get the names of input *.id files -> A
# get the names of output *.col files -> B
# compare the A and B
# conclusion: the failed runs has duplicate IDs:

# check if duplicated runs are because two SNPs are close to each other. 
# how to remove duplicated
# take the uniq entries in *.id, *.gwas.zscore and *.eqtl.zscore
# ENSG00000273486.1.ecaviar_col


#### why does some files take so long? 
# these files have very many loci (e.g. one has 700 or so)
# obviously these file contains multiple gwas hits 
# I will use the following algorithm to ensure each file contains only 1 gwas hit
# implemented in select_eGene.separate_gwas_loci.R
# for chromosome in 1 to 22: 
#	read eqtl on this chromosome 
# 	for gwas loci on this chromosome: 
# 		read gwas loci 
# 		merge gwas loci and eqtl 
# 		select eGenes (pval < 1e-3)
# 		output eGenes and associated variants 
# 	end for 
# end for
