# testing the beagle's conform-gt module:
# I flipped the alleles of rs138720731, and conform-gt successfully flipped back
# I also flipped the strand of rs73387790, and conform-gt reports OPPOSITE_STRAND
# For alleles not in the reference panel, conform-gt reports REMOVED and NOT_IN_REFERENCE
# Note that conform-gt reports FAIL for some correct SNPs likely because 
# the evidence for correct strand is inconclusive. 
# Since conform-gt incorrectly removes these "FAILED" variants, I need to construct vcf manually
