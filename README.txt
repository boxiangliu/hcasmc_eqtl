#### splicing QTLs (sQTLs)
#### 160629
(TBD) Leafcutter sQTL analysis
One of the top sIntrons for the SMAD3 loci is de novo. We visualized the loci by displaying RNAseq coverage summed across all samples on UCSC browser (figures/160629/smad3_loci_denovo_intron_RNAseq_coverage.png). The de novo intron is supported by some, but not much, RNAseq coverage. One sample, 1020301, does not show coverage in support of the de novo intron. One could suspect that this sample possesses a variant that favors against this intron. 


#### 2D visualization (MDS, t-SNE)
#### 160603 MDS 
TBA 

#### 160729 t-SNE
t-SNE is a low-dimensional visualization method that preserves the distance of closely related points. 

# combine_and_filter_rpkm.R
Genes were filtered with RPKM value > 0.1 in at least 80% of the samples. Genes that passes the filter are log transformed after an offset of 1. This resulted in gene expression profiles from a total of 16,383 genes. 
# tsne.2.R
The mean of each gene are normalized to zero. We performed the Barnes-Hut version of t-SNE using a perplexity of 30 (default) and no preprocessing with PCA. The optimization procedure of t-SNE does not guarantee the that the final 2D visualization represent the global optimum. Therefore, we performed 1000 iterations and present the one with the lowest cost function. In this 2D visualization, HCP and HCM (serum fed and serum starved) overlaps each other. They are surrounded by fibroblast, heart, artery, stomach, pancreas, and muscle. (figures/160729/tsne.seed.25.pdf)



#### HCASMC specific genes 
#### 160715
subsample.list.by.tissue.bl.R subsampled 10 individuals for each tissue and wrote the individuals to one txt file per tissue. 

subsample.R generated subsampled gct files using lists generated by subsample.list.by.tissue.bl.R.

combine_read_counts.sh combined all gct files of HCASMC into one gct file. 

find_housekeeping_genes.R found ~9,435 not differentially expressed across tissues with FDR 99%. The p-value distribution has a peak at 0 and another at 1 (see figures/160715/DE_p_value_distribution.pdf). In addition, p-value is inversely correlated with mean read depth. However, there are some genes with relatively high read depth and insignificant p-values (see figures/160715/mean_read_depth_vs_pvalue.pdf). The plot figures/160715/read_counts_across_tissue_for_DE_genes.pdf shows a couple examples of differentailly expressed genes. MDGA2 (ENSG00000139915.14) is a brain specific gene and FOXP1 (ENSG00000114861.14) is a transcription factor whose expression varies across tissue. 

Eisenberg and Levanon reported 3804 housekeeping genes across 16 human tissues. They also provided a narrow list of 11 highly uniform genes.  The plot figures/160715/read_counts_across_tissue_for_housing_keeping_genes_by_Levanon.pdf shows that some of reported housekeeping genes may not be uniformly expressed. 


# find_house_keeping_gene.R
To select bona fide invariant housekeeping gene, we employ a equivalence testing procedure in an ANOVA framework. However, since ANOVA assumes samples are normally distribution with equal variances, we needed to transform the data. Among log(x), sqrt(x), x^(2/3) and variance stabilizing transformations, the first and last performed the best in making the distribution symmetric (figures/160715/compare_transformations.pdf). In terms of decompling variance from the mean, the last performed the best(figures/160715/mean_vs_variance.pdf). The figure figures/160715/expression_by_tissue_raw_count_vs_vsn.pdf shows pre and post variance stabilizating transformation. It is difficult to judge whether the variances are more constant, but expression outliers has smaller effects after VSN. In addition, the mean variance dependency has been reduced. The equivalence test is implemented in equivalence.R. The testing procedure follows chapter 7 of the book testing_statistical_hypotheses_of_equivalence_and_noninferiority. However, I did not carry on with this approach since I do not fully understand it. 


# find_housekeeping_gene.2.R
An alternative approach is to set a minimum threshold on the expression value and a maximum threshold on the expression variance (as described in Levanon et al). These following filters: 
(i) expression observed in all tissues; 
(ii) low variance over tissues: standard-deviation [log2(RPKM)]<1;
(iii) no log2(rpkm) differed from the averaged by 1 (twofold) or more
identified 3391 housekeeping genes. Two examples of housekeeping and non-housekeeping genes are in figures/160715/{read_counts_for_hk_gene.pdf,read_counts_for_non_hk_gene.pdf} 


# ruvseq.R
RUVSeq was used to correct for the unwanted hidden variables. The housekeeping genes selected using mean and variance threshold were used as control genes. Raw read counts (not corrected with size factors) was used as input to RUVSeq. Removing 20 hidden factors were sufficient, as the relative log expression for each sample is distributed with ~0 mean and similar variances (/srv/persistent/bliu2/HCASMC_eQTL/figures/160715/rle_and_pca_after_ruv.*.pdf)


# find_hcasmc_specific_genes.R (with RUVSeq correction)
The residuals from ruvseq.R was used as input. HCASMC specific gene were found using a rank based statistic described as follows. Given a list L1 of N numbers 1:N and a second list L2 of n numbers, the test calculates the probability that the maximum member of an arbitrary list of lengh n is less than the maximum memeber of the list L2. In particular, p=choose(max(L),n)/choose(N,n). P-values using permuted dataset shows that the test is well-calibrated (/srv/persistent/bliu2/HCASMC_eQTL/figures/160715/qqplot_pvalues.pdf)After BH adjustment, 5151 genes are statistically significant at FDR 5%. However, most of these genes does not make biological sense. For instance, many top hits are olfactory receptor genes (OR6C65, OR8H3), which should not be expressed in HCASMC at all. On the other hand, known HCASMC specific such as MYH10 has insignificant p-value (see processed_data/160715/hcasmc_specific_genes.txt). The unexpected pattern indicates that there may have been overcorrection. To address this, one can try regressing against less unwanted factors, or leaving out the top unwanted factors as these may capture true biological variation. 


# ruvseq.2.R
I also tried using size factor corrected counts as input to RUVSeq. I rerun find_hcasmc_specific_gene.R using the residuals from ruvseq.2.R (results not saved) and the results were similar to ruvseq.R. This analysis eliminated library size as the reason for the unexpected results from find_hcasmc_specific_genes.R. 


# find_hcasmc_specific_genes.2.R (no RUVSeq correction)
Previously overcorrection was suspect for the unexpected result from find_hcasmc_specific_genes.R. To test this hypothesis, I used the extreme case of no RUVSeq correction at all. Using size factor corrected read counts, all synthetic HCASMC genes (CALD1, VIM, MYH10, TPM4, RBP1) are significant hits. The top hits includes the following:

EVI5 is ecotropic viral integration site 5. Most likely, this gene is upregulated due to Bovine serum virus. 
TFPI2 is Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor 2. Upregulation of TFPI2 is observed in the study "The expression of tissue factor and tissue factor pathway inhibitor in aortic smooth muscle cells is up-regulated in synthetic compared to contractile phenotype."
PXDN is Peroxidasin which is part of extracellular matrix secretion. 
ATP13A3 is a P-type ATPase which transport a variety of cations across the membrane. This is counter-intuitive since synthetic smooth muscle does not need to transport Ca2+. 

The plot figures/160715/heatmap.2.pdf shows that HCASCM specific genes separates HCASMC from the other tissues. 

# GSEA analysis
GSEA analysis shows that HCASMC specific genes are enriched in 
1. MYC targets
2. unfolded protein response
3. protein secretion
4. epithelial mesenchymal transition 
5. mTORC1 signaling (protein synthesis)
Enriched pathways are shown in figures/160715/gsea_enriched_pathways.png


# find_hcasmc_specific_genes.3.R
To understand whether each gene co-expression cluster correspond to any pathway, we performed hierarchical clustering using the top HCASMC-specific genes (FDR<1e-3, 4266 genes). A set of genes is assigned a cluster if the root of such cluster has height greater than or equal to the height of the root of the whole tree divided by 1.15 (note that this cutoff is ad hoc). A total of 4 clusters are formed, as shown in figures/160715/heatmap.3.pdf. PANTHER pathway analysis returned pathways specific to each of the 4 clusters (result stored in processed_data/160715/panther_hcasmc_specific_genes.{webarchive,txt}). Each gene cluster is enriched in multiple pathways. Note that the number of cluster can be tuned to maximize the number of discovered enriched pathways. However, I would like to discuss the current result before performing parameter tuning.

A contrast is used to compare HCASMC to 
1. all GTEx tissues

#### DE between serum-fed and serum-starved HCASMC
#### 160801:
# DESeq2_HCASMC_SF_vs_FBS.R 
To test the effect of bovine serum exposure to HCASMC gene expression, I performed differential expression analysis with the DESeq2 package. Using 1% FDR, a total of 2472 genes are differentially expressed, among with 1380 are upregulated and 1092 are downregulated upon serum treatment (figures/160801/HCASMC_SF_vs_FBS.pdf). The top differentially expressed genes falls into the category of cell cycle regulators (e.g. CDC20, NEK2, SPC25, DLGAP5, MYBL2), platelet activeation and inflammatory response (KIF20A), inhibition of apoptosis (MYBL2) and ubiquitination (UBE2C). 


# GSEA analysis:
To understand which pathways are perturbed upon serum stimulation, I performed GSEA analysis using the following 4 gene sets: 
1. Hallmark 
2. Cononical pathways (including BioCarta and KEGG)
3. Gene ontology Molecular function
4. Gene ontology Biological process 
5. Transcription factor binding

In the hallmark gene sets, pathways activated in the FBS condition includes cell cycle regulation, and protein secretion. 
Pathways activated in the SF condition is more convoluted: they include 
1. coagulation
2. heme metabolism (erythroblast differentiation)
3. myogenesis 
4. angiogenesis 
5. inflammatary response


In the conanical pathway gene set, the FBS sets are enriched in the following pathways: 
1. mitotic pathways
2. cardiac muscle, smooth muscle contraction (strange?)

the SF set are enriched with the following pathways: 
1. Notch signalling 
2. circadian expression
3. SMAD2/3 signaling etc

#### Fine-mapping by inspection
#### 160811
#### select top GWAS hits: extract_gwas_loci.R
I extracted the top GWAS hits from Nikpay 2015 NG. For each of the top GWAS hit, I extracted all tested genes (genes within 1MB from the variant) and plotted the association pvalue (../figures/160811/gwas_hits_gene_pval.pdf, using plot_gwas_hits_eqtl_pval.R). This plot suggests that two GWAS hits, rs273909 (SLC22A4-SLC22A5) and rs2521501 (FURIN-FES) are significantly associated with at least one gene (p-value <0.05). For rs273909, the top association is SLC22A4 (p<1.8e-4); for rs2521501, the top association is FES (p<2.0e-4). I then made locuszoom plot for both loci and observed coloclization at both loci. Notably, the top GWAS association overlaps the top eQTL association at rs2521501. Next, I made forestPM plot for both loci. For rs273909, HCASMC has the lowest p-value amonges all tissues. However, its m-value did not reach 0.9, likely due to small sample size. For rs2521501, artery, smooth muscle as well as HCASCM share low p-values, and all reached m-value of 0.9. 


#### eCAVIAR
I ran eCAVIAR using a pipeline described in Farhad's paper. 
1. select GWAS top variant
2. select the 50 up and downstream as the GWAS loci   
3. select the eGenes for at least variant in all loci
4. run eCAVIAR for each genes @ each loci
There are 6 loci that have CLPP greater than 0.01 


#### eGenes vs sample size
I plotted the number of eGenes vs sample size. The largest sample size is 361, and the smallest is 52. Figure "../figures/egenes_vs_sample_size/num_egenes_vs_sa_size.fullsize.pdf" shows regression on this range. HCASMC is slightly below the regression line. Figure "../figures/egenes_vs_sample_size/num_egenes_vs_sample_size.size150.pdf" shows regression from 52 to 150. In the latter, HCASMC seems to be on the regression line. 

#### tarid: 
This paper (http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/abstract/S1097-2765(14)00565-6) suggests that the exon 2 of TARID binds GADD45A. GADD45A demethylate and activate transcription of TCF21 (figure5a_arab_2014_molecularCell.png). The variant rs2327429 is a GWAS-eQTL colocalized variant. This variant is in exon 2 of TARID and A -> T changes the stability of the secondary structure(tarid_2nd_structure.png, tarid_2nd_structure_rs2327429_A_T.png)
