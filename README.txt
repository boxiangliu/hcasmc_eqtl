# 160604_phasing:
## compare the target VCF with reference VCF:
    convert_chrom_names.sh
    subset_vcf_to_first_4_col.sh
    compare_vcf_with_reference.scratch.R

conclusion: 
Many difference exists between the target and the reference VCF, especially in the ALT field. For example: 
22_16858229     C     C     T     A
These variants cannot be phased property, and conform-gt needs to be run. 

## run conform-gt
    make_list_of_non_caucasian_samples.hcasmc.R
    make_list_of_non_EUR_samples.1kg.sh
    run_conform_gt.sh

Result: 
In total, the conformed VCF has 12523334 lines, compared to 15463398 lines in the original VCF file. The difference is 2940064 lines, or 19%.

#### HCASMC specific genes 
#### 160715
subsample.list.by.tissue.bl.R subsampled 10 individuals for each tissue and wrote the individuals to one txt file per tissue. 

subsample.R generated subsampled gct files using lists generated by subsample.list.by.tissue.bl.R.

combine_read_counts.sh combined all gct files of HCASMC into one gct file. 

find_housekeeping_genes.R found ~9,435 not differentially expressed across tissues with FDR 99%. The p-value distribution has a peak at 0 and another at 1 (see figures/160715/DE_p_value_distribution.pdf). In addition, p-value is inversely correlated with mean read depth. However, there are some genes with relatively high read depth and insignificant p-values (see figures/160715/mean_read_depth_vs_pvalue.pdf). The plot figures/160715/read_counts_across_tissue_for_DE_genes.pdf shows a couple examples of differentailly expressed genes. MDGA2 (ENSG00000139915.14) is a brain specific gene and FOXP1 (ENSG00000114861.14) is a transcription factor whose expression varies across tissue. 

Eisenberg and Levanon reported 3804 housekeeping genes across 16 human tissues. They also provided a narrow list of 11 highly uniform genes.  The plot figures/160715/read_counts_across_tissue_for_housing_keeping_genes_by_Levanon.pdf shows that some of reported housekeeping genes may not be uniformly expressed. 


To select bona fide invariant housekeeping gene, we employ a equivalence testing procedure in an ANOVA framework. However, since ANOVA assumes samples are normally distribution with equal variances, we needed to transform the data. Among log(x), sqrt(x), x^(2/3) and variance stabilizing transformations, the first and last performed the best in making the distribution symmetric (figures/160715/compare_transformations.pdf). In terms of decompling variance from the mean, the last performed the best(figures/160715/mean_vs_variance.pdf). The figure figures/160715/expression_by_tissue_raw_count_vs_vsn.pdf shows pre and post variance stabilizating transformation. It is difficult to judge whether the variances are more constant, but expression outliers has smaller effects after VSN. In addition, the mean variance dependency has been reduced. The equivalence test is implemented in equivalence.R. The testing procedure follows chapter 7 of the book testing_statistical_hypotheses_of_equivalence_and_noninferiority. However, I did not carry on with this approach since I do not fully understand it. 


An alternative approach is to set a minimum threshold on the expression value and a maximum threshold on the expression variance (as described in Levanon et al). These following filters: 
(i) expression observed in all tissues; 
(ii) low variance over tissues: standard-deviation [log2(RPKM)]<1;
(iii) no log2(rpkm) differed from the averaged by 1 (twofold) or more
identified 3391 housekeeping genes. Two examples of housekeeping and non-housekeeping genes are in figures/160715/{read_counts_for_hk_gene.pdf,read_counts_for_non_hk_gene.pdf}
